Ahoy there, stranger!

I can see it in your eyes, the call of the sea, the thirst for adventure.
The open waters hold treasures untold,
but they also bring danger that only the brave can face.
My crew and I are sailing for fortune, fame,
and a taste of freedom that no landlubber will ever know.

But we’re in need of a strong hand,
a daring soul who’s willing to take the risks for the rewards that lie beyond the horizon.

What say ye? Will ye join us, fight beside us, and share in the plunder,
or will ye walk away and miss the greatest adventure of yer life?
The choice is yours, sailor... But once ye set foot on my ship, there's no turning back.

Now, what's ye name?
